* [DONE] configure-temporary-machine-for-ami: make it work with the newly built OpenFOAM.
* [DONE] configure-temporary-machine-for-ami: Upgrade FreeCAD to https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/tag/0.19.2
* [DONE] Make a working OpenFOAM application profile which allows to start OpenFOAM PBS jobs from WebUI.
* [DONE] ParaView: Install OpenGL3.2 or later.
    - /apps/soca/soca-2/cluster_node_bootstrap/ComputeNodeInstallDCV.sh[10] - add `g3s`
    - (optional) update the DCV version in config.cfg https://github.com/awslabs/scale-out-computing-on-aws/blob/8861c0c6c8b227852754f02cd6db316f00790890/source/scripts/config.cfg
    - In ParaView - on lefthand box - uncheck all checkboxes and leave only A320.
* Create a test PBS job to smoke test OpenFOAM.
* build-openfoam, configure-temporary-machine-for-ami: Upgrade OpenFOAM from https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-7/tags to https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-8/releases

* Support AMD instances (g4ad, 28% savings compared to g4dn):
    - Install RADEON drivers https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-amd-driver.html
    - Will it need a separate OpenFOAM/ParaView build (w/o Nvidia libraries)?
    - Intel MPI should work https://prace-ri.eu/wp-content/uploads/Best-Practice-Guide_AMD.pdf
* Does SOCA support spot (with jobs restart if failed)?
